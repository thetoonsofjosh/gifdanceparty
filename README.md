# Gif Dance Party
A recreation of a former website created in March 2013 by Fuzzy Wobble, It became viral on the internet! The site lasted until early 2019, It briefly came back around 2022 to 2023, but it wasn't the same as the original one.

This may also include stuff included from all eras of the original site, as well as the Gif Dance Party extension, which was like the site but characters can come to any site you wanted (Will be included in this GitHub)

Things to do in the site.
